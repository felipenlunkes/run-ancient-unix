	This release incorporates all fixes and changes made since the
	release of 2.10.1BSD in January 1989 as well as several missing
	pieces of 4.3BSD (the namei cache, tmscp driver, long filenames,
	etc.)

Bug reports, technical questions:

	Report bugs using the standard sendbug format (see bugfiler(1))
	WITH AN INDEX LINE OF "2.11BSD".
	General questions can be directed to Steven Schultz at 
	sms@wlv.iipo.gtegsc.com.  At this time, contact by phone is not 
	available due to a high degree of travel.  If you're really desperate, 
	print out a hardcopy example of the problem, and carefully mark your 
	place with a picture of your favorite president, preferably a large 
	denomination.  Send it to me.

	Bug fixes will be posted to comp.bugs.2bsd.
	Archives may be requested from Steven Schultz by electronic mail.  

	For an explanation of how unsupported this release is, read the 
	the remainder of this and the "changes" document, and keep
	in mind that this activity is not what pays the mortgage each month.

Credit where it's due:

	Paul Taylor of SUNY Oswego for volunteering to put 2.11BSD on
	his 11/73's back when it was known as 2.10.2SMS and fighting the 
	beta test problems, proofreading and critiqueing the documentation.  
	Terry Kennedy of St. Peter's College for final testing on a 11/70 and 
	for putting together an 11/73 for me.  Bob Karlicek of AT&T for 
	loaning me his 11/73 (on the basis of an Internet developed 
	acquaintance) to develop the TMSCP driver and related standalone 
	support.

In general:
	- The system hasn't been fit onto a non-separate I&D or machine
	  without a floating point processor in a long time.  Lots of overlay
	  schemes need to be worked out; the floating point simulator in
	  the kernel hasn't been tested; sendmail won't run on a non-separate
	  machine, so bin/mail and ucb/Mail have to auto-configure not to
	  use sendmail; csh is overlaid now even on a separate I&D machine,
	  /lib/cpp is pushing the limit to handle all the #define'ing that
	  is required to compile the kernel...

	  It is not anticipated the split I&D restriction will ever be lifted.
	  The historical trend is for systems and programs to increase in
	  size, not decrease.

Kernel:
	- Profiling hasn't been looked at in years.  It won't work as it is
	  because the supervisor mode has been allocated to the networking code.

	- The networking is very stable.  The DEQNA, DEUNA, DELUA, Interlan,
	  3Com, PRONET, ACC LH/DH-11 drivers are known to work;  others will
	  require some work.  Diffs are provided in /sys/OTHERS for the
	  VAX Excelan EXOS 204 driver.   The XNS code is ported, but has
	  to my knowledge never been compiled or tested.  The residual PUP
	  support has been removed (as it was in 4.3BSD).  SL/IP works but
	  can hang and not restart when you run out of CLISTs.  It would
	  probably be a good idea to increase CLISTs to the maximum when
	  running SL/IP.  

	  The DEQNA driver is a fresh port from 4.3BSD and is more stable
	  and much less susceptible to hanging than the old version.

	  Don't even THINK of using TRAILERS on *ANY* of the machines in your 
	  LAN.  In many cases the trailer code has been ifdef'd/commented out 
	  from 2.11BSD drivers, in other cases the trailer code has simply 
	  been ripped out.  In any case, the current drivers drop trailer
	  packets and increment the input packet error count.

	- The rtp call is wrong, any superuser call to turn off rtp will
	  turn it off, even if it's not the process itself requesting to
	  have its special status revoked.  The whole 'rtp' call should
	  probably go away.  As far as i know it has never been tested with
	  the present kernel and probably doesn't work.

	- There should be some way to monitor which overlays you're
	  switching between to aid in determining the best overlay scheme
	  for your kernel.

	- 2.10.X has not been made to run on the PRO series machines.  See
	  sys/OTHERS/PRO for more details and some helpful diffs.  The
	  OTHERS directory is quite useful, as it contains many other
	  versions of various drivers and such things.

	- The directory /sys/vaxif contains the source for the VAX networking 
	  drivers.  This is an excellent reference for adding new drivers and 
	  fixing current ones.

Applications:
	In some of the major source subdirectories you'll see, variously,
	subdirectories named OLD and PORT.  The OLD directories contain
	old 2.9BSD versions of software which were kept around for
	porting purposes.  The PORT directories contain 4.3BSD code that
	we didn't have time to port, but felt should be ported eventually.

	Due to the amount of software ported from 4.3BSD (and the Internet)
	the number of PORT directories has been cut down in order to fit
	the distribution on two 1600bpi tapes.  Many of the sources not included
	are available from INTERNET archive sites, others will have to be
	acquired from a friendly 4.3BSD site.

	There are only four OLD directories present in the system:  
	/usr/include/OLD, /usr/src/include/OLD (two .h files for support of 
	'ps'), /sys/pdpstand/OLD (unused standalone programs) and
	/usr/src/new/OLD where the 2.9BSD remnants are kept.

	- User level gprof profiling has not been implemented.  It should
	  be doable, just hasn't been time to do it.  Regular profiling
	  seems to be working fine however.

	- Lint hasn't been ported yet; the old version is in an unknown
	  state.  (it doesn't work)

	- Ucb/sysline compiles but doesn't run.  not a big loss really
	  unless you have a 25 line terminal.

	- Ucb/systat hasn't been ported.  but should be pretty easy EXCEPT
	  for the '-vmstat' display, much of the information there is simply
	  not applicable.

	- The acucntrl program in the usr.bin/uucp directory doesn't work.
	  It sets flags properly in the kernel, but the tty drivers don't
	  pay any attention to them.  See /sys/OTHERS/acucntrl for a fix
	  and comments.  The temptation was to simply adopt the 4.3BSD
	  soft-carrier mechanism and modify autoconfig to pass flags to
	  the driver.  For now the old method has been left in place.

	- The PDP-11 lisp hasn't been converted over to the new system
	  calling protocol; it's a fairly straightforward, mechanical
	  process, though.  You can find it in /usr/src/new/OLD/lisp11.tar.Z

	- Most of the applications under /usr/src/new have been tested
	  and work properly.  However, a large number of the 4.3BSD new
	  directory remains to be ported ...

	- Only some of the games have been tested.  Most compile, but ...


Man pages:

  The 4.3BSD-tahoe manual page system remains inplace from 2.10.1BSD.  
  Manual page source is generally contained under /usr/src/man.  Only 
  preformatted manual pages are stored under /usr/man.  The script 
  /usr/man/manroff is used to help format manual pages.  Man(1) has been 
  modified accordingly.  I'm not happy with this setup, it broke a
  symmetry i liked, but ...

  Because the 14 character limit on file name lengths has been lifted
  there are no manual page files whose names required truncation.

The man program will automatically truncate any names over MAXNAMLEN-2, but
since MAXNAMLEN is now 63 this should never be a problem unless manual
page filename lengths take on the attribute of a novella.

In general:
	- The system hasn't been fit onto a non-separate I&D or machine
	  without a floating point processor in a long time.  Lots of overlay
	  schemes need to be worked out; the floating point simulator in
	  the kernel hasn't been tested; sendmail won't run on a non-separate
	  machine, so bin/mail and ucb/Mail have to auto-configure not to
	  use sendmail; -DNONSEP needs to be passed up and down the make
	  files (or better yet, the new environment inheritance feature of
	  make should be used to pull out the environment variable MACHDEFS
	  and SEPFLAG);
	  ...

	  The reason this hasn't been done now is, as always, lack of
	  time.

Kernel:
	- Profiling hasn't been looked at in well over a year.  It
	  probably doesn't work.

	- The networking is stable.  The DEQNA, DEUNA, DELUA, Interlan
	  and 3Com drivers are known to work; the PRONET and others will
	  require some work.  Diffs are provided in /sys/OTHERS for the
	  VAX Excelan EXOS 204 driver. TCP/IP is in place and working;
	  XNS has been ported, but will contain more bugs than the mainstream
	  networking.  PUP hasn't even been looked at.  SLIP works, but
	  can hang and not restart when you run out of CLISTs.  DON'T EVEN
	  THINK OF USING TRAILERS on *ANY* of the machines in your LAN.

	- The rtp call is wrong, any superuser call to turn off rtp will
	  turn it off, even if it's not the process itself requesting to
	  have its special status revoked.  Probably need 3 defines:

		#define RTP_ON		1	/* turn it on */
		#define RTP_OFF		2	/* turn it off if I set it */
		#define RTP_FORCE_OFF	3	/* turn off everyone's */

	  If rtp(2) gets RPT_FORCE_OFF, it should find the process and
	  turn off the stuff, if necessary; question is if rtpp is the
	  flag that everyone checks for the existence of a run-time
	  process.

	- There should be some way to monitor which overlays you're
	  switching between to aid in determining the best overlay scheme
	  for your kernel.  Alternatively, and more correctly, gprof
	  should be implemented for the kernel.

	- The device number is not currently included in the buffer
	  hashing function, and probably should be.

	- 2.10 has not been made to run on the PRO series machines.  See
	  sys/OTHERS/PRO for more details and some helpful diffs.  The
	  OTHERS directory is quite useful, as it contains many other
	  versions of various drivers and such things.

	- A new directory has been added, /sys/vaxif, which contains the
	  source for the VAX networking drivers.  This is an excellent
	  reference for adding new drivers and fixing current ones.

Man pages:

  The new 4.3BSD-tahoe manual page system has been set up.  Manual page
source is generally contained under /usr/src/man.  Only preformatted
manual pages are stored under /usr/man.  The script /usr/man/manroff is
used to help format manual pages.  Man(1) has been modified accordingly
...

  Because of the 14 character limit on file name lengths, the names of the
following manual pages have been changed:

	Old name		New name
	--------		--------
	getdtablesize(2)	getdtabsize(2)

	getdiskbyname(3)	getdiskbynam(3)
	gethostbyaddr(3)	gethostbyadd(3)
	gethostbyname(3)	gethostbynam(3)
	getprotobyname(3)	getprotobyna(3)
	getprotobynumber(3)	getprotobynu(3)
	getservbyname(3)	getservbynam(3)
	getservbyport(3)	getservbypor(3)
	inet_makeaddr(3)	inet_makeadd(3)

	miscellaneous(7)	miscellaneou(7)

The man program will automatically truncate any names over MAXNAMLEN-2
(leaving room for the ".x" extension), so this should be transparent (at
least until we run into names which aren't unique within the first 12
characters ...
